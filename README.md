# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Analysis
The Project emphasizes upon finding the potential churners associated with an organization. We have Considered a global Telecommunication Dataset for our Project.
Finding the Potential Churning Rate also gives us the Idea about the retention rate for an organization. If we are able to predict Customer who might churn in a short span of time 
then the organiztion can use various multiple startergies like offering Discounts or giving an extension in their current plan for maximizing Retention.

This project Consist of :

1.) Main file ( Churn Pred Analysis) - Where all the code is wriiten

2.) PPT - A brief presentation of Churn Prediction Analysis

3.) Power BI Dashboard

4.) PDF for IPYNB

 Workflow for the Project(Main file) is :
 
 1.) Loading the Dataset and finding the general trends.
 
 2.) Performing EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):- 
 
 3.) Uni-variate and Bi-variate Analysis.
 
 4.) Using Encoding Techniques to convert categorical variable into numerical variables for Model Training.
 
 5.) Selection of Proper Evaluation Metrics. 
 
 6.) Model Training - Selection of different Models to try to increase our performance.
